                        <h3> Future plans</h3>
                        <p>
                            After completing my masterâ€™s degree, I wish to work in challenging work environments in companies
like Google, Facebook, apple where I would get a chance to prove my mettle as Software Engineer.
Here, I look forward to working with seasoned developers which would allow me to fine-tune my
technical skills and apply my knowledge of databases and applications. In the long-term, I wish to work
in a reputed company in the position of Chief Technology Officer which would give me the freedom to
contribute what I have learned through my education and real-life experiences.

                        <h3>Background </h3>
                        <p>
                            In the four years of my undergraduate study, I have been exposed to diverse topics in the field of CSE.
While the fundamental CSE strengthened my skills and knowledge of developing algorithms,
virtualization, and database, the advanced subjects like Subjects like Big Data, Database Management
System, Application Development, and Cloud Computing particularly interested me and motivated me
to pursue my further studies in these areas. I have also attended various training and workshops to
expand my knowledge base and further my interest.
As part of my curriculum, I chose my final year mini-project to develop an application to generate an
optimal timetable using a genetic algorithm. As a team of three, we formulated and researched various
algorithms which take certain constraints to provide an optimal solution. Further, we extended it by
adding lecturer option where one can tailor his own time-table. We used Java, java swing, MS access,
HTML for implementation of the project. The project helped me to understand how to connect an
application to a database and offered valuable insights into developing an application satisfying all
complexities. This experience further whetted my appetite to explore the field of computing and
databases.

                            Aside from Technology I am fond of sports, Cricket in particular. I have taken part in numerous
                            competitions and tournaments in school as well as college. In college, I got an opportunity to represent
                            my University in All India Inter School Cricket Tournament. Besides, I have had a chance to
                            successfully demonstrate my leadership skills when I organized a Hackathon workshop in college.
                            I also participated in an event of creating a largest human image of a wheelchair accessibility symbol
                            which created a Guinness world record of the department of CSE of Veltech Dr. RR and Dr. SR R&D
                            
                            Institute of Science and Technology. The main aim of the event is to create awareness among non-
                            disabled people that a person with a disability can be a vibrant member of society.
